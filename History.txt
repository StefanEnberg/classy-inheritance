== 0.3.0 2008-06-12
  * Add: :prefix parameter to depends_on call.  So if you have User.depends_on(:profile, :attrs => [:first_name], :prefix => true), your user model will have @user.profile_first_name.  This is to avoid name collisions with requisite classes.
== 0.2.1 2008-06-09
  * Add: exposed :can_be method.  Can now define what the polymorphic class can be with these methods.  This will add the "is_a_<model>?" and "as_a_<model>" methods.
  * Add: respond_to? :can_be test before adding to requisite class
== 0.2.0 2008-06-02
  * Add:  When defining a depends_on that is polymorhic the requisite class has two methods added: "is_a_<model>?" and "as_a_<model>".
== 0.1.1 2008-05-30
  * Fix:  Merge when other conditionals are passed to the find_with method was incorrectly called without bang!
== 0.1.0 2008-05-29
  * Initial release
