h2. Consolidation of information

Maintaining this page, the wiki at GitHub, the Google Group and no issue tracker is not an ideal setup.  So, everything is moving to "stonean.com":http://stonean.com where I'm giving "Redmine":http://redmine.org a shot a running everything for me. I'll be posting release announcements to the news feed for each project and keeping the docs up-to-date.  Hopefully this will be better for everyone.
