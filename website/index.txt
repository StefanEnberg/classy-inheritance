<i>You stay classy Inheritance</i>

h2. What

For now, Classy Inheritance adds a depends_on class method to your ActiveRecord model so that you can define requisite objects. 
More functionality coming for optional relationships.

You can define the relationship to be polymorphic:
<pre>
class Picture < ActiveRecord::Base
  depends_on :image, :attrs => [:filename, :height, :width], :as => "imageable"
end
</pre>

This will look for "imageable_type" and "imageable_id" on the images table add set them accordingly.

Or you can define a standard belongs_to relationship:
<pre>
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  depends_on :profile, :attrs => [:first_name, :last_name, :email]
end
</pre>

h3. What does it do for me?

Well, for starters you get pass-through methods added to your model.  So, in the above User example you would get the following:

<pre>
  @user.first_name
  @user.last_name
  @user.email
  @user.first_name=
  @user.last_name=
  @user.email=
</pre>

This means you can use these attributes on your form and in your controller instead of having to worry about creating/updating a separate Profile model.  

For the above example, you'll also get a "find_with_profile" class method that will do the :include => :profile addition to your find call for you.
